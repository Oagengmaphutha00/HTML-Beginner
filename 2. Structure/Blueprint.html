    In your eyes, the stars ignite,  
    A universe spun from loveâ€™s pure light.  
    Hand in hand, through joy and tears,  
    Bound by trust across the years.  

    Two souls entwined, a perfect dance,  
    A story written with each glance.  
    Through whispered dreams and laughter bright,  
    Your love shines strong, a guiding light.  

    May your days be warm, your nights be long,  
    Two hearts forever singing one song.  
    For love like yours will never fadeâ€”  
  A masterpiece the heavens made.

    I hope this captures the beauty of loveðŸ’–
