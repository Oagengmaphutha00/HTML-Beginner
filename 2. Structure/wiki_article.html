    <h5> Biography</h5>
    <p> Paul,[a] also named Saul of Tarsus,[b] commonly known as Paul the Apostle[7] and Saint Paul,[8] was a Christian apostle (c. 5 – c. 64/65 AD) who spread the teachings of Jesus in the first-century world.
      [9] For his contributions towards the New Testament,
       he is generally regarded as one of the most important
       figures of the Apostolic Age,[8][10] and he also founded
       several Christian communities in Asia Minor and Europe from
       the mid-40s to the mid-50s AD. <br> <br> The main source of information on Paul's life and works is the Acts of the Apostles in the New Testament. Approximately half of its content documents his travels, preaching and miracles. Paul was not one of the Twelve Apostles, and did not know Jesus during his lifetime.
        According to the Acts, Paul lived as a Pharisee and participated in the persecution of early disciples of Jesus, possibly Hellenised diaspora Jews converted to Christianity.
