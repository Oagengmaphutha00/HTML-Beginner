  <p>Raw sewage spills have disrupted and compromised the lives of Newlands West residents.

  Residents feel the municipality has failed them and has done nothing to fix the problem.

  The eThekwini metro has struggled to contain the leaks, which are frequently linked to infrastructure failures.

  eNCA reached out to the municipality, and theyâ€™ve promised to look into our inquiry. 

  eNCA's Nkosikhona Malinga-Mnisi filed this report.</p>
